            <h3>Lunar Surface Mobility Demo</h3>
            <p class="spaced">At NASA, I worked on project focused on multiagent lunar surface mapping, navigation, and hazard avoidance.
                The idea behind the project is, prior to sending astronauts back to the moon, we could send a team of robots that could map out
                a potential landing site and perform basic construction and landing zone setup.
                Below I've included a system overview, and then a few of the key contributions I personally made to the project.

<!-- AREAL -->
        <details>
            <summary>Georgia Tech - AREAL lab</summary>
            <p><strong>Title:</strong> Undergraduate Research Assistant</p>
            <p><strong>Dates:</strong> August 2021 – May 2024</p>

            <h3>Autonomous Quadrotor Landing on Moving Vehicle</h3>
            <p class="spaced">The main project I worked on at AREAL focused on autonomously landing a multi-rotor vehicle on a moving ground vehicle.
                As an undergraduate researcher, I was tasked with developing software and mechatronic
                features that enable autonomous capabilities for multi-rotor vehicles.  </p>

            <p class="spaced">My most significant contribution to this project was an infrared (IR) beacon localization package,
                which implements a coded beacon system in ROS 2 based on the work outlined in the paper “CoBe -- Coded Beacons for Localization,
                Object Tracking, and SLAM Augmentation” (Rabinovich et., 2017).  In short infrared beacons, which all look like
                identical white blobs to a camera, can each be uniquely identified by flashing a binary ID number at a known baud rate,
                where bright is a 1 and dim is a 0. These newly identified beacons can then be passed to OpenCV’s
                Perspective-n-Point solver which in turn gives us our multi-rotor’s relative pose.</p>

                <figcaption>Simple behavior tree tech demo.  In this video, we used a behavior tree to dequeue waypoints from a list
                    and send commands to PX4 which would fly the quadcopter to said waypoints.  After the list was empty, the behavior tree
                    would automatically return the drone to home and land.

            <p class="spaced">In addition to my localization package, I also setup a simple behavior tree test demo that would integrate the
                BehaviorTree.CPP library with ROS 2 (which was not a feature at the time)
                , and I designed a simple mechatronics board for the ground vehicle in Altium.</p>
