            <summary>Acting and Improv</summary>
            <p>I started acting and improvising my 2nd year of undergrad. Since then, I’ve performed 
                in two musicals (<i>The Trail to Oregon!</i> by Jeff Blim and <i>Calvin Berger,</i> by Barry Wyner),
                 one play (<i>The Diviners,</i> by Jim Leonard Jr.), 
                and dozens of various improv shows (a good number of which I also directed).  
                I’m currently taking an Advanced Meisner class with Rick Andosca, and 
                I’m also floating the idea of directing an improvised play with some of my old improv friends.</p>

            <summary>Guitar</summary>
            <p>I’ve been playing guitar loosely since high school on my dad’s old Gibson acoustic guitar, 
                but I got much more into music during the summer between my 3rd and 4th year of undergrad. 
                I went and bought myself a Fender Stratocaster and started my very own crappy garage band with my 
                roommate and some of our friends. We’ve played two gigs so far, and are excited to find our third one this upcoming semester!
            </p>

            <summary>Running, Climbing, and Soccer</summary>
            <p>Generally, I try to exercise 3-5 times a week.  Obviously, there are a ton of 
                physical benefits to this, but more than anything, I’ve found that exercise really helps to clear my mind.  
                I primarily run and climb, and recently I’ve been trying to get back into soccer which I really miss playing.
                <br><br>
                I don't take many photos of me exercising, so here's one of my highschool soccer photos.
